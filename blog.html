            <P> At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility â€” as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated</P>

        <P>researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</P>

      <P>1. Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.) 2. Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures exceeding 30oC (86oF), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 > 3 x 104.) 3. HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</P>

<P>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks</P>
